Scripts to generate plots in ["Quantifying the adaptive landscape of commensal gut shared.BACTERIA using high-resolution lineage tracking"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.13.491573v1) (Wong and Good, bioRxiv, 2022).

Data necessary to run scripts not currently present.
Scripts are written as (messy) Jupyter notebooks, but will convert to Python.

Python distribution: Python v3.9.7

Libraries: matplotlib v, numpy v, pickle v, scipy v, etc.
